<div class="about">
    <p>
        I am a student with a passion for exploring and learning new things. I have always been interested in Computer Science,
        more specifically the problem solving aspect and the satisfaction that comes with solving a problem
        that took a lot of work. Now, as a college junior studying CS,
        my passions are shifting toward ways I can use my knowledge to make an impact in this world.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>As an avid rock climber and hiker, I spend much of my time in nature. Being outside has a way of calming me and
        showing how beautiful life can be. But every time I am out enjoying nature, I can't help but think how fragile it is.
        This is where I am working to make my impact. With the growing threat of climate change
        and natural exploitation, it is now more important than ever to do what we can to help.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p> I plan to use my software engineering degree in combination with my forestry minor to work with companies that
        are making a difference in environmental conservation. Currently, I am looking for software engineering internships
        where I can hone my skills and become a more experienced engineer.

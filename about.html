    <p>
        I am a student with a passion for exploring and learning new things. I have always been interested in Computer Science,
        more specifically the problem solving and way of thinking in Computer Science. Now, as a college junior studying CS,
        my passions are shifting toward ways I can use my knowledge to make an impact in this world.

    <p>As an avid rock climber and hiker, I spend much of my time in nature. Being outside has a way of calming me and
        showing how beautiful life can be. But every time I am out enjoying nature, I can't help but think how fragile it is,
        and how much danger it is in. This is where I am working to make my impact. With the growing threat of climate change
        and natural exploitation, it is now more important than ever to do what we can to help.
    </p>

    <p> I plan to use my software engineering degree in combination with my Forestry minor to work with companies that
        are making a difference in environmental conservation. Currently, I am looking for software engineering internships
        where I can hone my skills and become a more experienced engineer.

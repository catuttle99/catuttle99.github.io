<div class="about">
    <p>
        I am a young professional with a passion for exploring and learning new things. I have always been interested in Computer Science,
        more specifically the problem solving aspect and the satisfaction that comes with solving a problem
        that took a lot of work. Now, as a young software engineer,
        my passions are shifting learning more about the industry and broadening my skillsets in new technologies.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>For a little more about me, I am an avid rock climber and hiker, and I spend much of my time in nature. Being outside has a way of calming me and
        showing how beautiful life can be. I also love cooking and really enjoy trying out new recipes and learning new techniques.
    </p>

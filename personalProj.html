    <!-- <h1>ReactJS</h1>
    <p>I am currently working on a ReactJS application</p> -->

    <h1>Ruby on Rails</h1>
    <p>Worked in a team to create a functioning peer review application where Administrators can
        create students, sections, and assign peer evaluations for the students in those sections to complete. <br/>
        The application can be found <a href="https://go-giters-final-app.herokuapp.com">here</a></p>

    <h1>Personal Travel Gallery</h1>
    <p>I used HTML and CSS grids to create a personal blog style travel gallery, where I display
    photos from various trips I have taken. A link to the gallery can be found on the top 
    navigation bar.</p>


    <h1>Elevate Android Application </h1>
    <p> Worked in a team of two to develop an android application called Elevate. It is a rock climbing training 
        application, where users can login to their account, and they will see workouts tailored to their skill
        level, with tutorials on how to complete them. Additionally, the app uses the Google Maps API 
        to show users any gyms in their area. We built the app with Java, and we used Room database from 
        the Android Architecture Components for our user and workout data. The Elevate repository 
        can be found <a href= "https://github.com/catuttle99/Elevate">Here</a></p>

    <h1> CORE Language Interpreter </h1>
    <p> Developed an interpreter for a simple, fictional language. Used java to write a Tokenizer, Parser,
    Executor, and Printer. Object Oriented Programming principles were used in the design of the Interpreter,
    and the parser was built using Recursive Descent Parsing. The interpreter repository can be
    found <a href="https://github.com/catuttle99/CORE-Interpreter">Here</a></p>

    <h1>Bookstore Database</h1>
    <p> Worked in a team to create a functional database for a fictional bookstore. We designed our ER diagram,
        relational schema, and then implemented the database using SQLite</p>

    <h1>Advent of Code</h1>
    <p>To better my coding and problem solving abilitieis, I am currently
    working on completing the 2020 Advent of Code challenge, which is 
    an online catalogue of coding problems, it can be found
